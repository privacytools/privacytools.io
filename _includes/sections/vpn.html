    <p><strong><a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad.net</a> </strong> is a fast and inexpensive VPN with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since <strong>2009</strong>. Mullvad is based in <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-se"></span> Sweden and does not have a free trial.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="35 Countries" %}</h5>
    <p>Mullvad has <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/servers/">servers in 35 countries</a> at the time of writing this page. Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination.</p>
    <p>We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service">dedicated servers</a>, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual private servers</a>.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Independently Audited" %}</h5>
    <p>Mullvad's VPN clients have been audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report <a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf">published at cure53.de</a>. The security researchers concluded:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">...Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In 2020 a second audit <a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2020/6/25/results-available-audit-mullvad-app/">was announced</a> and the <a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2020_v2.pdf">final audit report</a> was made available on Cure53's website.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Open Source Clients" %}</h5>
    <p>Mullvad provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their <a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app">GitHub organization</a>.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Accepts Bitcoin" %}</h5>
    <p>Mullvad in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong>, and <strong>cash/local currency</strong> as anonymous forms of payment. They also accept Swish and bank wire transfers.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="WireGuard Support" %}</h5>
    <p>In addition to standard OpenVPN connections, Mullvad supports WireGuard. WireGuard is an experimental protocol with theoretically better security and higher reliability, although it is not currently recommended for production use.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="IPv6 Support" %}</h5>
    <p>Mullvad supports the future of networking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>. Their network allows users to <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2014/9/15/ipv6-support/">access services hosted on IPv6</a> as opposed to other providers who block IPv6 connections.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Remote Port Forwarding" %}</h5>
    <p>Remote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">port forwarding</a> is allowed on Mullvad, see <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/port-forwarding-and-mullvad/">Port forwarding with Mullvad VPN</a>.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Mobile Clients" %}</h5>
    <p>Mullvad has published <a href ="https://apps.apple.com/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn">Google Play</a> clients, both supporting an easy-to use interface as opposed to requiring users to manual configure their WireGuard connections. The mobile client on Android is also available in <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn">F-Droid</a>, which ensures that it is compiled with <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/en/2019/05/05/trust-privacy-and-free-software.html">reproducible builds</a>.</p></p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="info" text="Extra Functionality" %}</h5>
    <p>The Mullvad VPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. The Mullvad website is also accessible via Tor at <a href="http://xcln5hkbriyklr6n.onion/">xcln5hkbriyklr6n.onion</a>.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN.com</a></strong> is a strong contender in the VPN space, and they have been in operation since <strong>2016</strong>.

They offer a further 14% discount for buying a 2 year subscription.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="44 Countries" %}</h5>
    <p>ProtonVPN has <a href="https://protonvpn.com/vpn-servers">servers in 44 countries</a> at the time of writing this page. Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination.</p>

    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Independently Audited" %}</h5>
    <p>As of January 2020 ProtonVPN has undergone an independent audit by SEC Consult. SEC Consult found some medium and low risk vulnerabilities in ProtonVPN's Windows, Android, and iOS applications, all of which were "properly fixed" by ProtonVPN before the reports were published. None of the issues identified would have provided an attacker remote access to a user's device or traffic. You can view individual reports for each platform at <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/open-source/">protonvpn.com</a>.
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Open Source Clients" %}</h5>

    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Accepts Bitcoin" %}</h5>
    <p>ProtonVPN does technically accept Bitcoin payments; however, you either need to have an existing account, or contact their support team in advance to register with Bitcoin.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="success" text="Mobile Clients" %}</h5>
    <p>In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, ProtonVPN has mobile clients for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/protonvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id1437005085">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.protonvpn.android&hl=en_US">Google Play</a> allowing for easy connections to their servers.

    <h5>{% include badge.html color="warning" text="No Port Forwarding" %}</h5>
    <p>ProtonVPN does not currently support remote port forwarding, which may impact some applications. Especially Peer-to-Peer applications like Torrent clients.</p>
    <h5>{% include badge.html color="info" text="Extra Functionality" %}</h5>
    <p>The ProtonVPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. ProtonVPN also offers "Tor" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we still strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">the official Tor Browser</a> for this purpose.</p>
