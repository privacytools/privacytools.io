    <h2>Mullvad <span class="badge badge-info">EUR â‚¬60/Year</span></h2>
    <p><strong>Mullvad</strong> is a fast and inexpensive VPN with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since <strong>2009</strong>. It is the only VPN provider that currently meets our criteria for recommendation. Mullvad is based in <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-se"></span> Sweden and does not have a free trial. Visit <a href="https://mullvad.net/">mullvad.net</a> to create an account.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">406+ Servers</span></h5>
    <p>Mullvad has 409 servers in 39 countries at the time of writing this page. Typically the more servers a provider offers, the better: With hundreds of servers in operation, you are far more likely to find a fast connection and a server geographically closest to you.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">WireGuard Support</span></h5>
    <p>In addition to standard OpenVPN connections, Mullvad supports WireGuard. WireGuard is an experimental protocol with theoretically better security and higher reliability, although it is not currently recommended for production use.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">Independently Audited</span></h5>
    <p>Mullvad's VPN clients have been audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report <a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf">published at cure53.de</a>. The security researchers concluded:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">...Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">Accepts Bitcoin</span></h5>
    <p>Mullvad in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong>, and <strong>cash/local currency</strong> as anonymous forms of payment. They also accept Swish and bank wire transfers.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-warning">No Mobile Clients</span></h5>
    <p>While iOS and Android clients are reportedly in the works, mobile users will need to use a traditional OpenVPN client and configuration files, which are a bit more difficult to configure.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-info">Extra Functionality</span></h5>
    <p>The Mullvad VPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. The Mullvad website is also accessible via Tor at <a href="http://xcln5hkbriyklr6n.onion/">xcln5hkbriyklr6n.onion</a>.</p>

    <h2>ProtonVPN <span class="badge badge-info">Free</span> <span class="badge badge-info">USD $96/year</span></h2>
    <p><strong>ProtonVPN</strong> is a strong contender in the VPN space, and they have been in operation since <strong>2016</strong>. ProtonVPN is based in <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-ch"></span> Switzerland and offers a limited free pricing tier, as well as premium options. Unfortunately due to its lack of an independent security audit it does not meet the complete criteria for recommendation, see our notes below.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-danger">Not Audited</span></h5>
    <p>ProtonVPN has not undergone a security audit by an independent third party, and therefore cannot be strongly recommended at this time. We have still chosen to list it on this page with the assumption that an audit will be published soon:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">We are currently undergoing a complete security audit of our VPN applications by a reputable Swiss security company. The results of the audit will be summarized in a public report for cases like this.</p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">Marc Loebekken, ProtonVPN AG Legal counsel</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We will reevaluate this listing at the end of 2019 or when the aforementioned report has been published, whichever is sooner.
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">526+ Servers</span></h5>
    <p>ProtonVPN has 526 servers in 42 countries at the time of writing this page. Typically the more servers a provider offers, the better: With hundreds of servers in operation, you are far more likely to find a fast connection and a server geographically closest to you.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">Accepts Bitcoin</span></h5>
    <p>ProtonVPN does technically accept Bitcoin payments; however, you either need to have an existing account, or contact their support team in advance to register with Bitcoin.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">Mobile Clients</span></h5>
    <p>In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, ProtonVPN has mobile clients for iOS or Android allowing for easy connections to their servers.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-info">Extra Functionality</span></h5>
    <p>The ProtonVPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. ProtonVPN also offers "Tor" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we still strongly recommend using the official Tor Browser for this purpose.</p>
