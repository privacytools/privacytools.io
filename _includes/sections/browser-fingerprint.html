<h1 id="fingerprint" class="anchor"><a href="#fingerprint"><i class="fas fa-link anchor-icon"></i></a> Browser Fingerprint - Is your browser configuration unique?</h1>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <strong>Your Browser sends information that makes you unique amongst millions of users and therefore easy to identify.</strong>
</div>

<p>When you visit a web page, your browser voluntarily sends information about its configuration, such as available fonts, browser type, and add-ons. If this combination of information is unique, it may be possible to identify and track you without using cookies. EFF created a Tool called <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> to test your browser to see how unique it is.</p>

<p>You need to find what <strong>most browsers</strong> are reporting, and then use those variables to bring your browser in the same population. This means having the same fonts, plugins, and extensions installed as the large installed base. You should have a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/">spoofed user-agent string</a> to match what the large userbase has. You need to have the same settings enabled and disabled, such as DNT and WebGL. You need your browser to look as common as everyone else. Disabling JavaScript, using Linux, or even using the Tor Browser Bundle, will make your browser stick out from the masses.</p>

<p>Modern web browsers have not been architected to assure personal web privacy. Rather than worrying about being fingerprinted, it seems more practical to use <a href="#addons"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> free software plugins</a> like Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin. They not only respect your freedom, but your privacy also. You can get much further with these than trying to manipulate your browser's fingerprint.</p>


<h3>Firefox Addon: CanvasBlocker</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/">addons.mozilla.org</a> - <strong>CanvasBlocker</strong> allows users to prevent websites from using some Javascript APIs to fingerprint them. Users can choose to block the APIs entirely on some or all websites (which may break some websites) or just block or fake its fingerprinting-friendly readout API.</li>
</ul>
