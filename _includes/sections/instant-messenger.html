<h1 id="im" class="anchor"><a href="#im"><i class="fas fa-link anchor-icon"></i></a> Encrypted Instant Messenger</h1>

<div>
    <p>We only recommend instant messenger programs or apps that support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end encryption (E2EE)</a>. When E2EE is used, all transmissions (messages, voice, video, etc.) are encrypted <strong>before</strong> they are sent from your device. E2EE protects both the authenticity and confidentiality of the transmission as they pass through any part of the network (servers, etc.).</p>

    <p>All the client programs/apps we chose are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open-source software</a> unless otherwise mentioned. This to ensure that the code can be independently verified by experts now and in the future.</p>

    <p>We have described the three main types of messaging programs that exist: Centralized, Federated and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), with the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>

    <h2 id="centralized" class="anchor"><a href="#centralized"><i class="fas fa-link anchor-icon"></i></a> Centralized</h2>

    <p>Centralized messengers are those where every participant is on the same server or network of servers controlled by the same organization.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>New features and changes can be implemented more quickly.</li>
        <li>Easier to get started with and to find contacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Centralized services could be more susceptible to <a href="#exploiting-centralized-networks">legislation requiring backdoor access</a>.</li>
        <li>Can include <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/08/Signal.html">restricted control or access</a>. This can include things like:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Being <a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165">forbidden from connecting third-party clients</a> to the centralized network that might provide for greater customization or better user experience. Often defined in Terms and Conditions of usage.</li>
            <li>Poor or no documentation for third-party developers.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/delisting-wire">ownership</a>, privacy policy, and operations of the service can change easily when a single entity controls it, potentially compromising the service later on.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2 id="federated" class="anchor"><a href="#federated"><i class="fas fa-link anchor-icon"></i></a> Federated</h2>

    <p>Federated messengers use multiple, independent servers that are able to talk to each other (email is one example of a federated service). Federation allows system administrators to control their own server and still be a part of the larger communications network.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows for greater control over your own data when running your own server.</li>
        <li>Allows you to choose who to trust your data with by choosing between multiple "public" servers.</li>
        <li>Often allows for third party clients which can provide a more native, customized, or accessible experience.</li>
        <li>Generally a less juicy target for governments wanting <a href="#exploiting-centralized-networks">backdoor access to everything</a> as the trust is decentralized. The server may be hosted independently from the organization developing the software.</li>
        <li>Server software can be verified that it matches public source code, assuming you have access to the server or you trust the person who does (e.g., a family member)</li>
        <li>Third-party developers can contribute code and add new features, instead of waiting for a private development team to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding new features is more complex, because these features need to be standardized and tested to ensure they work with all servers on the network.</li>
        <li>Some metadata may be available (e.g., information like "who is talking to whom," but not actual message content if E2EE is used).</li>
        <li>Federated servers generally require trusting your server's administrator. They may be a hobbyist or otherwise not a "security professional," and may not serve standard documents like a privacy policy or terms of service detailing how your data is utilized.</li>
        <li>Server administrators sometimes choose to block other servers, which are a source of unmoderated abuse or break general rules of accepted behavior. This will hinder your ability to communicate with users on those servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="peer-to-peer" class="anchor"><a href="#peer-to-peer"><i class="fas fa-link anchor-icon"></i></a> Peer to Peer (P2P)</h2>

    <p>Peer-to-Peer instant messengers connect directly to each other without requiring third-party servers. Clients (peers) usually find each other through the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">distributed computing</a> network. Examples of this include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT (distributed hash table)</a> (used with technologies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)">torrents</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a>, for example), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper">Whisper</a> protocol (used with some newer DApps). Another approach is proximity based networks, where a connection is established over WiFi or Bluetooth (for example, Briar or the <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz">Scuttlebutt</a> social networking protocol). Once a peer has found a route to its contact via any of these methods, a direct connection between them is made.</p>


    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimal information is exposed to third parties.</li>
        <li>Modern P2P platforms implement end-to-end encryption by default. There are no servers that could potentially intercept and decrypt your transmissions, unlike centralized and federated models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced feature set:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Messages can only be sent when both peers are online, however, your client may store messages locally to wait for the contact to return online.</li>
            <li>Generally increases battery usage on mobile devices, because the client must stay connected to the distributed network to learn about who is online.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> and that of the contacts you're communicating with may be visible if you do not use the software in conjunction with a <a href="/software/networks">self contained network</a>, such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> or <a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a>. Many countries have some form of mass surveillance and/or metadata retention.</li>
