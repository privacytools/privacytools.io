<p>It's important for a website like {{ site.name }} to stay up-to-date. Keep an eye on software updates for the applications listed on our site. Follow recent news about providers that we recommend. We try our best to keep up, but we're not perfect and the internet is changing fast. If you find an error, or you think a provider should not be listed here, or a qualified service provider is missing, or a browser plugin is not the best choice anymore, or anything else... <strong>Talk to us please.</strong> You can also find us on <a href="https://chat.privacytools.io">several Matrix rooms</a> mainly <code class="highlighter-rouge">#general:privacytools.io</code>. XMPP users can join there through <a href="https://conversations.im/j/%23general%23privacytools.io@matrix.org">#general#privacytools.io@matrix.org</a>. When using our services, users should follow our <a href="https://wiki.privacytools.io/view/PrivacyTools:Code_of_Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
