<p>It's important for a website like privacytools.io to be up-to-date. Keep an eye on software updates of the applications listed here. Follow recent news about providers that are recommended. We try our best to keep up but we're not perfect and the internet is changing fast. If you find an error, or you think a provider should not be listed here, or a qualified service provider is missing or a browser plugin is not the best choice anymore and anything else... <strong>Talk to us please.</strong> You can find us also on <a rel="me" href="https://social.privacytools.io/@BurungHantu">our own Mastodon instance.</a></p>
