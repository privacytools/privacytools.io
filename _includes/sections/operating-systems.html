<h4 id="cpuvulns">Remember to check CPU vulnerability mitigations</h4>

<p><em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073757/protect-windows-devices-from-speculative-execution-side-channel-attack">This also affects Windows 10</a>, but it doesn't expose this information or mitigation instructions as easily. MacOS users check <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210108">How to enable full mitigation for Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities on Apple Support</a>.</em></p>

<p>When running a enough recent kernel, you can check the CPU vulnerabilities it detects by <code>tail -n +1 /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*</code>. By using <code>tail -n +1</code> instead of <code>cat</code>, the file names are also visible.</p>

<p>
    In case you have an Intel CPU, you may notice "SMT vulnerable" display after running the <code>tail</code> command. To mitigate this, disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">hyper-threading</a> from the UEFI/BIOS. You can also take the following mitigation steps below if your system/distribution uses GRUB and supports <code>/etc/default/grub.d/</code>:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>sudo mkdir /etc/default/grub.d/</code> to create a directory for additional grub configuration</li>
  <li><code>echo GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT mds=full,nosmt" | sudo tee /etc/default/grub.d/mds.conf</code> to create a new grub config file source with the echoed content</li>
  <li><code>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> to generate a new grub config file including this new kernel boot flag</li>
  <li><code>sudo reboot</code> to reboot</li>
  <li>after the reboot, check <code>tail -n +1 /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*</code> again to see that MDS now says "SMT disabled."</li>
</ol>
