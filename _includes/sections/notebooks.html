<h3>Warning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Note: As of Dec 2018, Joplin does not support password/pin protection for the application itself or individual notes/notebooks. Data is still encrypted in transit and at sync location using your master key. See <a href='https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/289'>open issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
