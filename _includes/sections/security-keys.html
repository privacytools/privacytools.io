<h3>Worth Mentioning</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">Nitrokey</a> - A variety of security key products for different workloads. All Nitrokey products are open-source and customizable. The <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/sites/default/files/NitrokeyFirmwareSecurityAuditReport05-2015.pdf">firmware</a> and <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/sites/default/files/NitrokeyHardwareSecurityAuditReport08-2015.pdf">hardware</a> have been independently assessed by Cure53 in 2015. We have found that there is no best overall product (the <em>Pro 2</em> lacks Curve25519 while the lower-end <em>Start</em> supports it, for example) and they are lacking a variety of form factors such as USB-C and NFC that would be more convenient for many users.</li>
