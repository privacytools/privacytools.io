<p>If you're asked to enter a custom homeserver URL in a Matrix client, enter <code>https://chat.privacytools.io</code>, <strong>not</strong> privacytools.io or element.privacytools.io. You do not need to change your identity server, in fact <code>https://vector.im</code> is the only functional one, by design.</p>

<p>These details will be autofilled for you in most clients if you enter your full username (e.g. @alice:privacytools.io rather than alice) into the username field. In general it is preferable to do that rather than trying to remember what the homeserver URL is.</p>

<h2 class="pt-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>Is #general:privacytools.io or #privacy:privacytools.io chat end-to-end encrypted?</h4>
<p><strong>No.</strong> Messages sent to the #general chat are encrypted from with client-to-server encryption, i.e. HTTPS. This means that your messages can't be viewed by an attacker on your network, or your ISP, etc. <strong>However</strong>, because this is a public chat room anybody can view your messages if they are a member, and newcomers will be able to see all message history. Do not say anything in rooms that don't use End-to-End (E2E) encryption that you wouldn't want tied to you personally.</p>

<h4>Isn't Matrix behind Cloudflare?</h4>
<p>The default matrix.org homeserver is behind Cloudflare. The PrivacyTools homeserver is not.

<h4>Isn't Matrix slow?</h4>
<p>It can be, for some! Due to the trememdous amount of people registering on the matrix.org homeserver, it is often overloaded and occasionally slow to respond. Therefore, users on that homeserver occasionally report a less than ideal chat experience. If that's you, you can fix this problem by switching to another homeserver. Good alternatives include...
  <ul>
    <li>ours of course, at <mark><strong>chat.privacytools.io</strong></mark>, you're here right?</li>
    <li>feneas.org, tchncs.de, weho.st, pine64.org, kde.org, halogen.city...</li>
    <li>purchasing an instance from <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a></li>
    <li>running your own by installing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> — certainly the best option for the technically inclined!</li>
  </ul>
<p>Note that at time of writing, switching homeservers requires re-registering with another account at that server, as nomadic identities haven't been implemented yet.</p>

<h4>What happens when I remove a message in Element?</h4>
<p>Your homeserver will send a removal request for that message and some clients will render it as a black line, but by editing the source it's possibly for homeserver to not respect it and do nothing. If the room is bridged to protocols that don't support message removals (IRC, XMPP), their users see nothing happening. Don’t say anything you wouldn’t want to remain in the chat forever.</p>

<h4>Why do XMPP users keep joining and leaving all the time?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost/issues/63">It's an issue with the XMPP bridge</a>.</p>

<h4>I'm not using the PrivacyTools homeserver, can I find PrivacyTools rooms in Element?</h4>
<p>Yes! Open the room explorer (compass icon on Element desktop), click the server selection drop down next to the search bar, click "Add a new server", type <code>privacytools.io</code>, and click Add. You should then be able to view and search through rooms that the PrivacyTools server is aware of. Note that not every room hosted on PrivacyTools is affiliated with or moderated by the PrivacyTools team.</p>
