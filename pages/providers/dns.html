<h4>Terms</h4>

<ul>
  <li>DNS-over-TLS (DoT) - A security protocol for encrypted DNS on a dedicated port 853. Some providers support port 443 which generally works everywhere while port 853 is often blocked by restrictive firewalls. DoT has two modes:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Oppurtunistic mode: the client attempts to form a DNS-over-TLS connection to the server on port 853 without performing certificate validation. If it fails, it will use unencrypted DNS.

        tooltip="In other words automatic mode leaves your DNS traffic vulnerable to SSL strip and MITM attacks."
        %}</li>
        <li>Strict mode: the client connects to a specific hostname and performs certificate validation for it. If it fails, no DNS queries are made until it succeeds.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) - Similar to DoT, but uses HTTPS instead, being indistinguishable from "normal" HTTPS traffic on port 443.

    tooltip="DoH contains metadata such as user-agent (which may include system information) that is sent to the DNS server."

  <li>DNSCrypt - An older yet robust method of encrypting DNS.</li>

<h4>How to verify DNS is encrypted</h4>

<ul>
  <li>DoH / DoT
    <ul>
      <li>Check <a href="https://www.dnsleaktest.com/">DNSLeakTest.com</a>.

        icon="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"
        tooltip="Your DNS provider may not appear with their own name, so compare the responses to what you know or can find about your DNS provider. Just ensure you don't see your ISP or old unencrypted DNS provider."
        %}</li>
      <li>Check the website of your DNS provider. They may have a page for telling "you are using our DNS." Examples include <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html">AdGuard</a> and <a href="https://1.1.1.1/help">Cloudflare</a>.</li>
      <li>If using Firefox's trusted recursive resolver (TRR), navigate to <code>about:networking#dns</code>. If the TRR column says "true" for some fields, you are using DoH.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>dnscrypt-proxy - Check <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Checking">dnscrypt-proxy's wiki on how to verify that your DNS is encrypted</a>.</li>
  <li>DNSSEC - Check <a href="https://dnssec.vs.uni-due.de/">DNSSEC Resolver Test by Matth√§us Wander</a>.</li>
  <li>QNAME Minimization - Run <code>dig +short txt qnamemintest.internet.nl</code> from the command-line (taken from <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/presentations/unbound_qnamemin_oarc24.pdf">this NLnet Labs presentation</a>). If you are on Windows 10, run <code>Resolve-DnsName -Type TXT -Name qnamemintest.internet.nl</code> from the PowerShell. You should see this display: <code>"HOORAY - QNAME minimisation is enabled on your resolver :)!"</code></li>

      <li><em>Firefox</em> comes with built-in DoH support with Cloudflare set as the default resolver, but can be configured to use any DoH resolver.

        Currently Mozilla is <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/07/31/dns-over-https-doh-update-detecting-managed-networks-and-user-choice/">conducting studies</a> before enabling DoH by default for all US-based Firefox users.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>DNS over HTTPS can be enabled in Menu -> Preferences (<code>about:preferences</code>) -> Network Settings -> Enable DNS over HTTPS. Set "Use Provider" to "Custom", and enter your DoH provider's address.</li>
              <li>Advanced users may enable it in <code>about:config</code> by setting <code>network.trr.custom_uri</code> and <code>network.trr.uri</code> as the address you find from the documentation of your DoH provider and <code>network.trr.mode</code> as <code>2</code>. It may also be desirable to set <code>network.security.esni.enabled</code> to <code>True</code> in order to enable encrypted SNI and make sites supporting ESNI a bit more difficult to track.</li>
