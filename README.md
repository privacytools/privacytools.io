# Contributing

It's important for a website like PrivacyTools to be up-to-date. Keep an eye on software updates of the applications listed here. Follow recent news about providers that are recommended. We try our best to keep up but we're not perfect and the internet is changing fast. So if you find an error, or you think a provider should not be listed here, or a qualified service provider is missing or a browser plugin is not the best choice anymore or anything else...

**Talk to us!** If you want to help make privacytools.io the best website it can be, join our Matrix discussion chat at [`#dev:privacytools.io`](https://matrix.to/#/#dev:privacytools.io), where we talk about open issues and PRs in this repo, and changes to the site. You may submit any website suggestions here on GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues).
