    Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a
    pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I
    want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." <strong>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</strong></p>

  <img src="assets/img/layout/UKUSA.png" class="img-fluid float-right" alt="UKUSA Agreement" style="margin-left:10px;">

  <p>The UKUSA Agreement is an agreement between the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to cooperatively collect, analyze, and share intelligence. Members of this group, known as the <a href="https://www.giswatch.org/en/communications-surveillance/unmasking-five-eyes-global-surveillance-practices">Five Eyes</a>,
  focus on gathering and analyzing intelligence from different parts of the world. While Five Eyes countries have agreed to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/an-exclusive-club-the-five-countries-that-dont-spy-on-each-other">not spy on each other</a>			as adversaries, leaks by Snowden have revealed that some Five Eyes members monitor each other's citizens and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa">share intelligence</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett">avoid breaking domestic laws</a>			that prohibit them from spying on their own citizens. The Five Eyes alliance also cooperates with groups of third-party countries to share intelligence (forming the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes), however Five Eyes and third-party countries can and do
  spy on each other.</p>

  <!-- Key disclosure law -->
  <h1 id="kdl" class="anchor"><a href="#kdl"><i class="fas fa-link anchor-icon"></i></a> Key Disclosure Law</h1>  <h3>Who is required to hand over the encryption keys to authorities?</h3>
  <p>Mandatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law">key disclosure laws</a> require individuals to turn over encryption keys to law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation. How these laws are implemented (who may be legally compelled to assist) vary from nation to nation, but a warrant
  is generally required. Defenses against key disclosure laws include steganography and encrypting data in a way that provides plausible deniability.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> involves hiding sensitive information (which may be encrypted) inside of ordinary data (for example, encrypting an image file and then hiding it in an audio file). With plausible deniability, data is encrypted in a way that prevents an
  adversary from being able to prove that the information they are after exists (for example, one password may decrypt benign data and another password, used on the same file, could decrypt sensitive data).</p>

  <h3 id="usa" class="anchor">Why is it not recommended to choose a US-based service?</h3>

  <img src="assets/img/layout/USA.png" class="img-fluid float-right" alt="USA" style="margin-left:10px;">

  <p>Services based in the United States are not recommended because of the country's surveillance programs, use of <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters/faq">National Security Letters</a> (NSLs) and accompanying gag orders, which
  forbid the recipient from talking about the request. This combination allows the government to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/08/more_on_the_nsa.html">secretly force</a> companies to grant complete access to customer data and
  transform the service into a tool of mass surveillance.</p>

  <p>An example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit#Suspension_and_gag_order">Lavabit</a> – a discontinued secure email service created by Ladar Levison. The FBI <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nzz888/lavabit-founder-ladar-levison-discusses-his-federal-battle-for-privacy">requested</a>			Snowden's records after finding out that he used the service. Since Lavabit did not keep logs and email content was stored encrypted, the FBI served a subpoena (with a gag order) for the service's SSL keys. Having the SSL keys would allow them to access
  communications (both metadata and unencrypted content) in real time for all of Lavabit's customers, not just Snowden's.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Levison turned over the SSL keys and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email">shut down</a> the service at the same time. The US government then <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100962389">threatened Levison with arrest</a>,
  saying that shutting down the service was a violation of the court order.</p>  <h3>Related Information</h3>

  <img src="assets/img/layout/warrant-canary.jpg" class="img-fluid float-right" alt="Warrant Canary Example" style="margin-left:20px;">
  <p>A warrant canary is a posted document stating that an organization has not received any secret subpoenas during a specific period of time. If this document fails to be updated during the specified time then the user is to assume that the service has
  received such a subpoena and should stop using the service.</p>

  <!-- fingerprint image to the right of the paragraphs -->
  <img src="assets/img/layout/browser-fingerprint.jpg" class="img-fluid float-right" alt="Fingerprint image" style="margin-left:20px;">

  <!-- first paragraph -->
  <p>When you visit a web page, your browser voluntarily sends information about its configuration, such as available fonts, browser type, and add-ons. If this combination of information is unique, it may be possible to identify and track you without using
  cookies. EFF created a Tool called <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> to test your browser to see how unique it is.</p>

  <!-- First orange "test your browser now" button -->
  <p>
  <a class="btn btn-warning" href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">
    Test your Browser now
  </a>
  </p>

  <!-- second paragraph -->
  <p>You need to find what <strong>most browsers</strong> are reporting, and then use those variables to bring your browser in the same population. This means having the same fonts, plugins, and extensions installed as the large installed base. You should
  have a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/">spoofed user agent string</a> to match what the large userbase has. You need to have the same settings enabled and disabled, such as DNT and WebGL. You need your browser to
  look as common as everyone else. Disabling JavaScript, using Linux, or even the TBB, will make your browser stick out from the masses.</p>

  <!-- third paragraph -->
  <p>Modern web browsers have not been architected to assure personal web privacy. Rather than worrying about being fingerprinted, it seems more practical to use <a href="#addons"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> free software plugins</a> like Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin and Disconnect.
  They not only respect your freedom, but your privacy also. You can get much further with these than trying to manipulate your browser's fingerprint.</p>

  <h3>How to disable WebRTC in Firefox?</h3>

  <!-- steps on manually disabling WRTC in Firefox -->
  <p>In short: Set "media.peerconnection.enabled" to "false" in "about:config".</p>
  <p><strong>Explained:</strong></p>
  <ol class="long-string-list">
    <li>Enter "about:config" in the firefox address bar and press enter.</li>
    <li>Press the button "I'll be careful, I promise!"</li>
    <li>Search for "media.peerconnection.enabled"</li>
    <li>Double click the entry, the column "Value" should now be "false"</li>
    <li>Done. Do the WebRTC leak test again.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you want to make sure every single WebRTC related setting is really disabled change these settings:</p>
  <ol class="long-string-list">
    <li>media.peerconnection.turn.disable = true</li>
    <li>media.peerconnection.use_document_iceservers = false</li>
    <li>media.peerconnection.video.enabled = false</li>
    <li>media.peerconnection.identity.timeout = 1</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now you can be 100% sure WebRTC is disabled.</p>

  <h3>How to fix the WebRTC Leak in Google Chrome?</h3>
  <p>WebRTC cannot be fully disabled in Chrome, however it is possible to change its routing settings (and prevent leaks) using an extension. Two open source solutions include <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-leak-prevent/eiadekoaikejlgdbkbdfeijglgfdalml">WebRTC Leak Prevent</a> (options may need to be changed depending on the scenario), and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">uBlock Origin</a> (select "Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses" in Settings).</p>

  <h3>What about other browsers?</h3>
  <p>Chrome on iOS, Internet Explorer and Safari does not implement WebRTC yet. <a href="#browser"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> But we recommend using Firefox on all devices.</a></p>  <!-- Firefox add-ons -->

  <h3>Stop Tracking with "Privacy Badger"</h3>
  <img src="assets/img/addons/Privacy-Badger.png" class="img-fluid float-left" alt="Privacy Badger" style="margin-right:30px;">
  <p><strong>Privacy Badger</strong> is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web. Privacy Badger learns about trackers as you browse by inspecting external resources websites request. Please be aware that Google Analytics is considered first-party by Privacy Badger, which means that Google Analytics will not be blocked if you do not use another blocker, such as uBlock Origin.

  <h3>Block Ads and Trackers with "uBlock Origin"</h3>
  <img src="assets/img/addons/uBlock.png" class="img-fluid float-left" alt="uBlock" style="margin-right:30px;">
  <p>An efficient <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode">wide-spectrum-blocker</a> that's easy on memory, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there. It has no monetization strategy and
  is completely <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">open source</a>. We recommend Firefox but uBlock Origin also works in other browsers such as Safari, Opera, and Chromium. Unlike AdBlock Plus, uBlock does not allow so-called <a href="https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads">"acceptable ads"</a>.

    <p>Founded in 2011 by former Google engineers and a consumer-and privacy-rights attorney. The addon is open source and loads the pages you go to 27% faster and stops tracking by 2,000+ third-party sites. It also keeps your searches private. If you are planning to install "uBlock Origin" make sure to install "Disconnect" first. <strong>Alternative to Disconnect:</strong> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/">Privacy Badger by EFF</a>

  <ol class="long-string-list">
    <li>privacy.firstparty.isolate = true
      <ul>
        <li>A result of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift">Tor Uplift</a> effort, this preference isolates all browser identifier sources (e.g. cookies) to the first party domain, with the goal of preventing tracking across different domains. (Don't do this if you are using the Firefox Addon "Cookie AutoDelete" with Firefox v58 or below.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>privacy.resistFingerprinting = true
      <ul>
        <li>A result of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift">Tor Uplift</a> effort, this preference makes Firefox more resistant to browser fingerprinting.</li>

    <li>privacy.trackingprotection.enabled = true
      <ul>
        <li>This is Mozilla's new built-in tracking protection. It uses Disconnect.me filter list, which is redundant if you are already using uBlock Origin 3rd party filters, therefore you should set it to false if you are using the add-on functionalities.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>browser.cache.offline.enable = false

  <h3>Interesting Email Providers Under Development</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.confidantmail.org/">Confidant Mail</a> - An open-source non-SMTP cryptographic email system optimized for large file attachments. It is a secure and spam-resistant alternative to regular email and online file drop services. It
      uses <a href="https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/gpg.html">GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)</a> for content encryption and authentication, and TLS 1.2 with ephemeral keys for transport encryption.</li>
  </ul>  <h3>Become Your Own Email Provider with Mail-in-a-Box</h3>

  <p>Take it a step further and get control of your email with this easy-to-deploy mail server in a box. Mail-in-a-Box lets you become your own mail service provider in a few easy steps. It's sort of like making your own Gmail, but one you control from top
  to bottom. Technically, Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh cloud computer into a working mail server. But you don't need to be a technology expert to set it up. <strong>More: <a href="https://mailinabox.email/">https://mailinabox.email/</a></strong></p>

  It's important for a website like privacytools.io to be up-to-date. Keep an eye on software updates of the applications listed here. Follow recent news about providers that are recommended. We try our best to keep up but we're not perfect and the internet
  is changing fast. If you find an error, or you think a provider should not be listed here, or a qualified service provider is missing or a browser plugin is not the best choice anymore and anything else... <strong>Talk to us please.</strong>						</p>
